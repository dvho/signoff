## Notes
With a plethora of email validation utilities available it's remarkable how many fail to fully adhere to the relevant RFC specifications, neglect to accommodate valid formatting idiosyncrasies such as domain literals and quoted strings, are superfluously laden with excess code or suffer from all of these issues concurrently. [_Signoff_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signoff) distinguishes itself by meticulously addressing these common pitfalls, testing entries against a series of rigorous criteria derived from all the pertaining RFC specifications and providing a robust solution. It tests the length and structure of the entry against _RFC 5321_ and _RFC 5322_, scrutinizes the handle in accordance with _RFC 5321_ accounting for quoted strings while adhering to RFC 5322, and inspects the domain through the lens of _RFC 1035_ in consideration for domain literals, honoring both IPv4 and IPv6 formats, following ยง4.1.2 of _RFC 5321_ and _RFC 4291_, respectively.


## Installation
With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do
```bash
$ npm install signoff
```
